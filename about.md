title: Thomas Belin, Lead Web front-end architect @ Wire
---

# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Thomas

I'm from France and I live in Paris.

I'm a front-end engineer with a particular love for **improving legacy codebases**.  
My areas of expertise are **React**, **Functional Programming** and **general front-end application architecting**.

I'm currently leading the web team at [Wire](https://wire.com/en/), a secure messenger.  
Together with my team of 6 people, we shape the future of Wire's end-to-end encryption protocol based the brand-new [MLS protocol](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/).  
Everything we do is **Open Source** and can be found in the [Wire webapp GitHub repository](github.com/wireapp/wire-webapp/).

I have started my career in 2012 working as the only front-end developer of [DoYouBuzz](https://doyoubuzz.com/).
Back then, the application was entirely written in jQuery and was... well... a mess!  
This is probably where I understood the concept of spaghetti code...  
In 2013 and I **led the front-end migration of DoYouBuzz from jQuery to AngularJS** (back then [React](https://reactjs.org/) was not even a thing).  

While working at DoYouBuzz, I also was very active in the tech community of my hometown, Nantes. I gave a few talks at [NantesJS](https://nantesjs.org/) and eventually got hooked into public speaking!
My proudest moment was probably giving a lightning talk at [dotjs](https://www.dotjs.io/) 2016 about writing [UI as pure functions of time](https://www.dotconferences.com/2016/12/thomas-belin-user-interfaces-as-pure-functions-of-time).  
You can find [all my talks here](/talks/)!  

I also got very involved in the [Cycle.js](https://cycle.js.org/) community and became an active contributor to the project.  
I got to meet incredible people, among which [AndrÃ© Staltz](https://staltz.com/) who has positively influenced my technical skills like no-one before!  
I'm forever grateful to have had the opportunity to work with AndrÃ©!

In general, I'm very curious and eager to learn!
