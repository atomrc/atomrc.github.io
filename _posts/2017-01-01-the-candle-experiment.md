- designed an api (from scratch with hapi) for my students to code the front-end that will consume the api. The api is very basic (some kind of twitter clone with public only messages). It's a first working version but also very rudimentary (no error handling for example). (as rauchg says https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/817871796909158400). After this session, the basic features are available (user creation, login/authentication using jwt, message listing, message creation)
- add few features to the Absurde SÃ©ance website (svg logo, menu items activation)
- submitted a talk for Devoxx France

- redesigned the look and feel of my blog. I was tired of the previous version of my blog so I simplified it a lot and did some performances optimizations (split css styles between home page and the article page, remove font-awesome that I was using for 2 logos on the whole blog)
- started the candle experiment's blogpost
