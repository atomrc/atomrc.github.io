Late September 2017, after three months of work, at DoYouBuzz we released the first iteration of a migration from AngularJS to Cycle.js.

I would like to share with you how we were able to do an iterative migration by embedding a Cycle.js app into an existing Angular one.
I would also like to share what are the specific constraints we have at COMPANY_A (SEO, PDF generation) and how we managed them with our shiny new front-end. 
I would like to show you how Cycle.js and Reactive Programming completly changed the semantic of our codebase ... For the best!
