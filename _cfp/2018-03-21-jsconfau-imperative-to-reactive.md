Late September 2017 at DoYouBuzz, after three months of research, tests and hard work, we released the first iteration of a major change of our front-end: a migration from AngularJS to Cycle.js.

This first step was rich in learnings and discoveries that I would like to share with you.

Why did we need to move from Angular in the first place?  
Why did we choose Cycle.js as a replacement?  
How did we manage to initiate a progressive migration by embedding a Cycle app into an existing Angular one?

I would like to show you how Cycle.js and Reactive Programming completly changed the semantic of our codebase ... For the best!
